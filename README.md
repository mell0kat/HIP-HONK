# HIP-HONK
_Revolutionizing the car horn market_

### Why?

Because bad New York driving is the most senseless, infuriating spectacle humanity has ever known.
	Has a black car ever nearly killed you in a crosswalk, only for the driver to lay on their horn and get upset at YOU? Have you seen USPS trucks blatantly run red lights? Have you avoided garbage trucks driving a quarter mile the WRONG WAY down a one way street? Have you sat at intersections for a half-hour because selfish motorists would rather “block the box” than wait 2 minutes for another green light?
	I have, and I don’t have the words to express my anger — but maybe… just maybe, my favorite Hip-Hop artists do.

### What?

Built using good-old vanilla JS and hand-crafted CSS Animations, Hip Honk is the only customizable car horn on the market today that utilizes the hyper-powerful, non-verbal lyrics of today’s most prominent Rap and R&B artists.
	The next time an Uber driver doesn’t respect your right-of-way, don’t just yell weak insults or simmer silently, let him or her know that karma will come back to haunt them for 1000 eternities by unleashing the animalistic bark of DMX, or the startling “Yuh” of Chance the Rapper.
	Sometimes words aren’t enough, and the best lyrical geniuses of the Hip-Hop game know this. That’s why Hip-Honk harnesses this power for your own personal gain.
